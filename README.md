# WingtipToysForJenkins
This is a personnel project to run and test jenkins CI on local system.

The sample project which is meant to learn Jenkin installation and setting it up on local system.


The Project is an ecommerce online toy shop developed in ASP.NET C#. The code is not written by me. It is meant to teach ASP.NET to anyone. The orginal code is available in Microsoft doc files tutorial.


First not so serious branching git excercise.
